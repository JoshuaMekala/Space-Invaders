# Space-Invaders

There are multiple apps in this file

Explosions.py demonstrates how the explosions work. Simply click on the screen and explosions will occur.

Fireworks.py shows randomly exploding fireworks in front of UMass Amherst. The program will run once opened, and the user does not have to do anything else.

Game1.py is a game where the user has to click on the aliens to gain points.

Game2.py is a typical space invaders game where the user tries to avoid the aliens while also shooting them. The keys for this use the arrow keys.
